    """
    This feature is designed to accomodate the following use cases:
    - The Magnet Group frequently ships products from a single order to multiple shipping addresses. (The average number of shipping addresses on a single order is 6.) Orders typically consist of a single type of item with a single specification and artwork.
    - Manufacturing orders will be used to describe the work necessary to produce a custom-printed item. Because of long setup times it is highly desireable to have a single manufacturing order represent a single print run.
    - Quantity pricing in Odoo is calculated using the quantity on a single sale order line item.
    - It is highly desireable to invoice a single type of item sold to a single customer on the same invoice line.
    1. Interface modificaions to the sale order:
    1.1. On the sale order line pop-out form view, the user should be able manage an in-form list of delivery addresses and the quantity of the item to be shipped to that address.
    1.2. This list should be populated by default with the SO delivery address and the entire SO line quantity
    1.3. When saving a sale order line:
    1.3.1. If the entire ordered quantity of the sale order line is not allocated, allocate the remainder to the default shipping address. Return a non-blocking warning message with the following text:
    "You have allocated less quantity to delivery addresses than were orders. The remaining units have been allocated to the order's shipping address."
    1.3.2. If the allocated quantity exceeds the ordered quantity, increase the ordered quantity to match the allocated quantity. Return a non-blocking warning message with the following text:
    "You have allocated more quantity to delivery addresses than were ordered. The ordered quantity has been increased. To decrease the ordered quantity, unallocate items from their delivery addresses."
    Technical Note:
    Create a new model sale.order.line.address with the following fields
    -sale_line_id (corresponds to delivery_partner_ids on the sale.order.line)
    -product_id
    -quantity
    -partner_id
    -tax_ids?
    Add a new o2m field the the sale order line, delivery_partner_ids.
    To the bottom of the sale order line pop-out form view, add a bottom-editable tree view for delivery_partner_ids with the following fields:
    -partner_id
    -quantity
    On creation of a sale order line, create one line.address record where:
    sale_line_id = self
    partner_id = self.shipping_partner_id
    product_id = self.product_id
    quantity = self.quantity
    1.4. A user should be able to import a csv or excel file to create line.address records. This import file is expected to have some or all of the following fields and should allow the user to reference existing addresses or create them at the time of import.
    name
    internal reference (res.partner)
    parent contact
    street1
    street2
    state
    zip
    country
    phone
    email
    quantity
    2. When a sale order is confirmed, create one delivery order per delivery address. 
    Limitation Note:
    Scheduled delivery date will be set at the sale order line level, so any modifications to schedule date on a per-line address level must be made after confirmation of the sale order.
    Technical Note:
    On confirmation of the sale order, create one procurement for each line line.address.
    3. Create a draft state for manufacturing orders. A manufacturing order should be in state draft until it is manually confirmed by a user. MOs in a draft state should not affect the stock forecast. If a new procurement is created where product and all attribute values match an existing draft MO, add the items to the MO rather than creating a new one.
    3.1. The user should be able confirm multiple manufacturing orders at once by selecting them in the list view and running an action.
    Technical Note: Create a contextual action for the mrp.production named "Confirm Manufacturing Orders".

    Addendum
    This addendum is an extension and clarification of item 1.4 in the original spec regarding a tool for importing sale line delivery addresses.
    
    Purpose
    While the majority of orders are shipped to fewer than 10 addresses, it is nonetheless common to receive orders which must be shipped to several hundred addresses. Ten(10) such orders are received each day in the smallest company in the group, Castelli. Other companies in the group receive 20-30 such orders each day.
    The primary priority for this feature is usability. The process should be as simple and streamlined as possible.
    
    Functional Specification
    1. On the sale order line form view, just above the delivery addresses list, include a button titled "Import Delivery Addresses". Clicking the button should redirect the the user to upload a file. This file is expected to be a CSV or XLSL file with columns representing the following fields, though not all fields will have values every time:
    name
    street
    street2
    city
    state
    zip
    country
    phone
    email
    parent company
    Delivery Quantity
    It should be possible to create a partner directly from this import, filling the fields above. The default type of any partners created via import here should be delivery address.
    Functional Note:
    In the vast majority of cases new partners will be created.
    2. In order to reduce the chance of error when putting together import files, there should be a human-readable unique identifier for each sale order line that can be used during import. It should be constructed as follows: {Sale Order Number} - "Line" {Line Item Number} - {Product Template Name}. For example, "SO1234 - Line 1 - Example Product"
    Functional Note:
    Does using the line item number make sense? Changing the line item order would change the unique identifier, which could potentially cause problems.
    Technical Note:
    Could we just update the external identifier?
    3. Users should only be able to import sale order order line delivery addresses for the sale order line they initiate the import from.
